## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

### What I learned

I realised that by using the right semantics I could interact with the DOM more easily.
Was stuck with keyboard interaction but I've learned that if we use `<button>` we can interact directly.

### Continued development

Keep practicing, want to learn JS more and more.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand how the accordion work and to implement the button.
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - Like always this is so helpful.
